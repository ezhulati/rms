    <h1>Worry Time Worksheet</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Worry Time is a cognitive-behavioral technique that helps manage anxiety by setting aside a specific time each day dedicated to worrying. This approach helps contain worries to a designated period rather than allowing them to intrude throughout your day. By postponing worries to a specific time, you can reduce anxiety and improve your ability to focus on the present moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Scheduled Worry Time</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces the amount of time spent worrying throughout the day</li>
            <li>Increases control over worry thoughts</li>
            <li>Improves ability to focus on present activities</li>
            <li>Creates a boundary around worry, making it more manageable</li>
            <li>Helps distinguish between productive problem-solving and unproductive rumination</li>
            <li>Reduces the emotional impact of worries by addressing them systematically</li>
            <li>Improves sleep by reducing nighttime worry</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>How to Use Worry Time</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Schedule a specific worry time:</strong> Choose a 15-30 minute period each day to be your designated "worry time." Select a time that's not too close to bedtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Notice worries throughout the day:</strong> When you catch yourself worrying outside your scheduled time, briefly note the worry in the worry log below.</li>
            <li><strong>Postpone the worry:</strong> Tell yourself, "I notice I'm worrying about this now, but I'll think about it during my worry time instead."</li>
            <li><strong>Refocus your attention:</strong> Gently bring your focus back to the present moment or the task at hand.</li>
            <li><strong>During worry time:</strong> Review your worry log and spend time thinking about each worry. For each one, consider:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is this worry about a problem I can solve?</li>
                    <li>What steps can I take to address this problem?</li>
                    <li>If it's not solvable, how can I accept the uncertainty?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>End worry time:</strong> When your scheduled worry time is over, put away your worry log and engage in a different activity.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>My Worry Time Schedule</h2>

        <h2>Tips for Effective Worry Time</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Try to stick to your scheduled worry time each day, even if you don't have many worries to process.</li>
            <li><strong>Create the right environment:</strong> Choose a specific location for worry time that's comfortable but not too relaxing.</li>
            <li><strong>Set a timer:</strong> Limit worry time to 15-30 minutes. When the time is up, move on to another activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Distinguish between productive and unproductive worries:</strong> For solvable problems, focus on action steps. For uncertainties you can't control, practice acceptance.</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> This technique takes practice. You may find it difficult to postpone worries at first, but it gets easier with time.</li>
            <li><strong>End positively:</strong> After worry time, engage in a pleasant or absorbing activity to shift your mental focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust as needed:</strong> If 15 minutes feels too short, you can extend worry time, but try not to exceed 30 minutes.</li>
