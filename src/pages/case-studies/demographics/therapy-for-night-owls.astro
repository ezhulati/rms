          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Sofia</strong>, a 28-year-old bartender at a high-end cocktail lounge in Chicago, had always been a natural night owl. Even as a child, she'd stayed up reading past midnight, feeling most creative and energized in the late evening hours. Her profession suited her chronotype perfectly—she worked 6 PM to 3 AM, Thursday through Monday, and loved the energy of the nightlife industry.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But by early 2024, the lifestyle that once felt freeing had become isolating. Most of her friends worked traditional 9-5 jobs and had started families. Weekend brunch invitations arrived when she was sound asleep. Her partner, who worked as an elementary school teacher, kept a drastically different schedule. They'd see each other for an hour in the evening before she left for work, and she'd arrive home long after he was asleep.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Sofia had tried therapy three times in the past, but the recurring barrier was always the same: therapists' availability. The earliest evening appointments were 5 or 6 PM—right when she needed to start getting ready for work. Taking a morning appointment meant sacrificing sleep, arriving foggy and exhausted, making the sessions feel counterproductive. Eventually, she'd give up on therapy altogether.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            By February 2024, Sofia's anxiety had intensified. She experienced racing thoughts during her commute home, had trouble falling asleep despite exhaustion, and felt a persistent sense of loneliness. Her partner gently suggested she try therapy again, mentioning he'd seen ads for online platforms that offered flexible scheduling.

            Sofia was matched with <strong>Dr. Rachel Martinez</strong>, a licensed clinical psychologist who specialized in anxiety disorders and had personal experience as a night owl herself. Dr. Martinez offered appointments until midnight EST, which meant Sofia could have sessions at 9 or 10 PM Chicago time—perfect for her between getting up and heading to work.

            Key Takeaways for Night Owls Seeking Therapy
          </h2>

          <div class="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Your Chronotype is Valid</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                Being a night owl is a biological trait, not a character flaw. Effective therapy should work with your natural rhythm, not force you to change it. Research shows that 15-20% of people have delayed sleep phase preferences, and trying to force an incompatible schedule can worsen mental health.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Online Therapy Offers Real Flexibility</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                Many online therapy platforms offer evening and late-night appointments (some until midnight EST or later). This isn't just convenience—it means you can attend therapy when you're alert and engaged, making treatment more effective. Look for therapists who explicitly list evening/night availability.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Find a Therapist Who Understands</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                Not all therapists understand non-traditional schedules. During intake or your first session, explicitly discuss your chronotype and schedule needs. A good therapist will validate your schedule and work collaboratively to design interventions that fit your life, not the other way around.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Social Isolation is Common but Solvable</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                Many night owls and shift workers experience social isolation because society operates on a 9-5 schedule. Building community with others who share your schedule (coworkers, online communities, late-night fitness classes) can significantly reduce loneliness while maintaining relationships with "day people" through intentional scheduling.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Optimize Sleep Hygiene for Your Schedule</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                Sleep hygiene principles apply to night owls too, just on a different clock. Blackout curtains, white noise, consistent sleep/wake times (even if that's 5 AM to 1 PM), and pre-sleep routines all improve sleep quality regardless of when you sleep. The key is consistency with your natural rhythm.
