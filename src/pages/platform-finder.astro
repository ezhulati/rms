              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Consider Your Budget</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Online therapy platforms vary widely in price, from budget-friendly options under $50 per week to premium services that can cost over $100 per week. Consider what you can realistically afford on an ongoing basis, as therapy is often most effective when maintained consistently over time. Some platforms offer financial aid or sliding scale pricing based on income.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Evaluate Insurance Coverage</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                If using insurance is important to you, focus on platforms that accept insurance plans. Keep in mind that even with platforms that accept insurance, your specific plan may not be covered, or certain services might be excluded. Always verify coverage directly with both the platform and your insurance provider before committing.

              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Different platforms specialize in treating different conditions and demographics. Some excel at anxiety and depression treatment, while others focus on relationship counseling, PTSD, or specific populations like teens or the LGBTQ+ community. Choose a platform with therapists experienced in addressing your particular concerns.

              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Online therapy platforms offer various communication methods, including text messaging, live chat, phone calls, and video sessions. Think about how you prefer to communicate and which methods would make you feel most comfortable opening up to a therapist.
