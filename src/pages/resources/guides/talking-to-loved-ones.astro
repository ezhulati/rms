            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Talking to loved ones about your mental health can feel vulnerable and scary—but it's also one of the most powerful steps you can take. <strong>You don't have to suffer in silence.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Opening up allows your loved ones to understand what you're going through, offer support, and feel less shut out. It also reduces the burden of hiding your struggles and can deepen your relationships.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-4">
              <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Remember:</h3>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 italic">
                You deserve support. Mental health struggles are not a sign of weakness, and asking for help is an act of courage, not burden.
