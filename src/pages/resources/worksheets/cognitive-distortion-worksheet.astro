            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Cognitive distortions are patterns of biased thinking that can negatively impact our emotions and behaviors. They're like mental shortcuts that our brains take, but these shortcuts often lead us to inaccurate conclusions about ourselves, others, and situations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Recognizing and challenging these distortions is a core component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), one of the most effective evidence-based treatments for anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns.
